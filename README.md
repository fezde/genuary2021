# genuary2021
Participation in the [#genuary2021](https://genuary2021.github.io/) month of generative code building.

I will be using [Plingo](https://github.com/fezde/plingo) only to get as much exposure to the new language as possible and research more into its possibilities.

To see the results, visit [the page of this project](https://fezde.github.io/genuary2021/)
