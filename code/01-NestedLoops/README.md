## Prompt
> `// TRIPLE NESTED LOOP`

## Idea
```
Take a piece of paper
for 1..3
    Manually write loop on paper
    Scan and crop
    Run plingo for 121 iterations on scan
    print result
    Take print
next
```

This will result in 3 animations where the last one represents the three nested loops
