                Do some code golf! How little code can you write to make something interesting? Share the sketch and its

            <h3>Interpretation</h3>
            "As little code" in Plingo translates as "as small an input picture as possible".<br />
            The smallest possible image would have been a one-pixel-image. But the possibilities there are quite limited
            (you can go for <span>add</span>, <span>substract</span>, or <span>invert</span> as commands), so I decided
            to do a second, little more complex
            program.<br />
            This program consists of a 4 by 3 pixels. All but the top left pixels are initialized so they call
            <span>noop</span> and thus do not change. The top left pixel is initialized with RGB(13, 1, 1) which
            translates as <span>swap_plus_plus(1,1)</span> . This will make the first pixel "travel" one pixel down and
            to the right, switching the place with the pixel that occupied that space before. This makes the pixel
            travel across the canvas while shuffling the rest of the image.<br />

            This video was created using <a
                href="https://github.com/fezde/genuary2021/blob/main/code/05-Golf/05-golf.png" target="_blank">this
                image</a> as an input. The video presented here has been scaled up a lot to make the code and its result
            better viewable.<br />
            The execution is basically (without the video creation): <span>plingo -i 1000 05-golf.png</span>
