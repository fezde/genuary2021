            <h3>Interpretation</h3>
            <p>
                Both input images were created using process that introduces randomness because of their nature.
                Reflections created by taking the pictures introduce another level of uncontrolled color changes. The
                combination of both effects is close to real randomness.
            </p>
            <p>
                While the black-and-white image creates the ususal b/w noise, the colorful image is the first one in
                this row of experiments that actually created colors during its rendering process.
